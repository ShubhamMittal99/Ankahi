            <h3>
<p>The man, the myth, the legend!</p>
                <p><br>
Arguably the best showman Ankahi has ever witnessed, Shubham Tambi, the director of the street play team is immensely famous for his iconic roles and charming personality. Be it the righteous Krishna or a gracious antagonist only he could pull off, he mesmerized the audience whenever he entered the circle. A perfect blend of talent, dedication, enthusiasm and dark humour, he was the best mentor we could possibly hope for. He constantly stood there with us throughout our journey, working passionately every day on our skills even when no one else could. Life will be so much harder when he won't be there to say "Chill Kar bro Mai dekh lunga". </p><p><br>
Thank you for bringing the best out of us. Thank you for holding this team together. Thank you for always being there when needed. Thank you for everything. 
Farewell Tambi sir, we love you 3000! ‚ù§Ô∏è 
                </p>
<p><br>May you succeed in all your future endeavors!</p></h3>

            <h3>‚ÄòRishte mein to hum Drama ke baap lagte hain, naam hai Saurabh Kumarüòé'
                <p><br>
This man needs no introduction. Perhaps one of the finest Dramatists IIT Delhi has ever produced, the skill and enthusiasm of Saurabh towards Dramatics is unmatchable. Acting, Direction, Production and what not; he knows them all better than anyone.
                </p><p><br>
Saurabh Kumar was the director of the Stage team and apart from being a stupendous dramatist; he has nurtured a Drama culture at IIT which will be remembered for generations. Every play, every production; he was there to support and encourage us to achieve our full potentials and he brought out the best in us like no one ever could. Awards and recognitions (he has a lot of them!) are not even close to showing what you have done for this club and we are grateful to you for everything. Thank you Shambhu Ji/Bachhan/etc., etc. for making Ankahi what it is today! We wish you all the very best and success in your life and career ahead and we hope to make you proud!

            <h3>
                <p>
                    Take it from a person who had absolutely no sense of scale, or take it from a person for whom music is the strong suit; both will be incomplete awe of what this guy has been able to create with a bunch of instruments. 'One man army', as the street team calls him very dearly, is the perfect description of this super duper musician.
                </p>
                <p><br>
"Aage xylo, bagal me harmonium, niche Djembe and haath me guitar" could be the perfect words to define him during the weeks before any major event. As long as he was there, no one ever had to worry about what would happen to the music, because "Rao sir sambhal lenge". He is the reason half the people in the street team could sit in the parodies when all their roles were taken away. He is the reason the Mandli wanted to perfect their beats, his hardwork and dedication truly drove us all to push ourselves harder.
                </p>
                <p><br>
He is the one who has given us the best memories. His infinite jamming sessions will most definitely be the one thing that the entire dramatics society will miss. It's his aura and the magic that he creates with his guitar, that once he starts playing, automatically everyone close by will join to sing along. 
                </p>
                <p><br>
What Rao sir has given us, can never be replaced, such a personality has never been seen in Dramatics ever. He'll continue to be loved, adored and respected by everyone. Now that he's going, we hope that he still continues to help us and shower the generations to come with his music sense and awesomeness!

One of the rare persons in dramatics who gets the real essence of a script, hats off to your knowledge of literature. You are a spectacular actor and director and yet so humble. The way you take up any character, be it Das Babu/ Pancha or any other, your efforts are commendable.
                </p><p><br>
As a director you have worked really hard to help us develop from scrap. You are the reason that people like us, who had no inclination towards dramatics initially are so attached to this family. Thank you for being there in ups and downs of every production and motivating us. You made us believe in ourselves. We wish you all the very best for the upcoming challenges in your career. You will be missed Nazish Sir.

                </p><p><br>
                Akhilesh Sir's contribution to the club is unmatchable both in front of the stage and at the back of it. Quite a many plays would not have been possible without him taking charging of building the large and detailed sets. He is our power source, he is the hulk of our team, a ONE MAN ARMY and one of the most talented actors in our college.
                </p><p><br>
Ankahi - the Dramatics Society of IIT Delhi would like to celebrate his contribution for the club in the past four years at our college. Performances, like, Manohar, Vakil, Darshinghar, Sundal Lal (magistrate) , Genie, Bali, Sudhir have made a special place in our hearts. 
                </p><p><br>
He is one of the main reasons that our Dramatics Club is able to reach such heights. We thank you Akhilesh Verma for your contribution and wish you all the luck for your future. "Oioi oioioi"

            <h3>The man, the myth, the legend!
                <p>Arguably the best showman Ankahi has ever witnessed, Shubham Tambi, the director of the street play team is immensely famous for his iconic roles and charming personality. Be it the righteous Krishna or a gracious antagonist only he could pull off, he mesmerized the audience whenever he entered the circle.

He constantly stood there with us throughout our journey, working passionately every day on our skills even when no one else could. Life will be so much harder when he won't be there to say "Chill Kar bro Mai dekh lunga".</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing the best out of us. Thank you for holding this team together. Thank you for always being there when needed. Thank you for everything. 
    Farewell Tambi sir, we love you 3000! ‚ù§Ô∏è </p>
